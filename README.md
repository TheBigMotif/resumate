# Resumate

## Description

Given the necessity of new graduates and people changing careers to incorporate into the working market as soon as possible, it can become a very stressful task. Candidates need to prepare a resume, portfolio, LinkedIn profile, and sometimes even a Github/Gitlab profile.

To take the burden out of them, we created an application that will help them create the most crucial component of their career package, the resume. With Resumate, candidates can prepare a professional resume enhanced by Artificial Intelligence with just little input.

By creating this application, we learned to persevere through team work. We put into practice the use of Apollo Server and Client, GraphQL, React, MongoDB and reinforced the knowledge of Node.js and Express.js to create a powerful and valuable application.
